		<h2>The Academy for Math, Science, and Engineering</h2>
		<p>
			The Academy for Math, Science, and Engineering, a magnet high
			school located on the Morris Hills campus, is a rigorous 
			program that selects bright students from all over Morris County.
			In their time at the Academy, students follow a curriculum that
			exposes them to many advanced STEM topics. As part of Morris County's
			vocational school district, the Academy serves as a preparatory program
			for students who are interested in pursuing STEM careers. 
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Magnet Program for Math and Science</h2>
		<p>
			In addition to the Academy, Morris Hills also has a math and science
			magnet program. Similarly to the Academy, it is a highly focused and rigorous four-years honors program. 
			Students will take many of the school’s advanced placement math and science courses, while having the flexibility to pursue other disciplines at the honors level. 
			The foundation of the program is centered around a series of three researched based analysis (RBA) courses where students will receive special training in research methods, scientific investigation, advanced data analysis, and technical writing, leading to independent research.  
			By the end of the program students will become well-versed in the process of scientific research from start to finish, by developing a professional, well-organized and original research project. 
			Students will present their findings through several communication channels and have the opportunity to submit their work for publication.
