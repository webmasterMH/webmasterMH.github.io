	   <h1>Design Brief: Drones</h1>
	   <h2>Introduction</h2>
	   <p>
	   On December 21, 2015, tech magazine <span id = "italic">Mashable</span> wrote that 2016 would be the year of the drone. Indeed, drones have permeated our
	   entire society, moving from military usage to our everyday lives. In fact, over two dozen universities now offer education
	   and courses about these Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Here we will address some of the information that it is
	   important to know as these devices become more and more commonplace. 
	   </p>
	   <h2>Usage</h2>
	   <p>
	   The key uses of drones are for imagery and delivery. On the imagery side, film production companies are looking into using 
	   more drones to film scenes, which cuts down on production costs. The scenes that drones can capture with their cameras are 
	   expanding the media world, creating more realistic and more impressive imagery as time goes by, which is espcially useful
	   to advertising. Researchers are using drones to monitor things like traffic patterns, animal behavior, and topology. And of course, drones are 
	   used recreationally among regular people who just like the fun of drone imagery. On the delivery side, agricultural use of 
	   drones is currently on the rise, as companies develop more powerful drones that can spray more farmland. Drones are also starting 
	   to be seen as replacements for helicopters, doing all the things helicopters can do but for a much cheaper price. This is
	   especially relevant to companies such as Amazon and Domino's, who are interested in using drones to deliver their 
	   products. The Canadian Royal Mail service has even expressed interest in using drones to deliver the mail. Of course, there
	   are some usages of drones that don't fall into either category, like Shell's usage of drones in hard-to-reach places to
	   maximize safety and efficiency, usage of drones for natural disaster relief, and usage of drones in search and rescue missions.

	   <h2>Technology</h2>
	   <h3>Current Technology</h3>
	   <p>
	   	
	   </p>
	   <h3>Future Technology</h3>
	   <p>
	   As previously mentioned, many companies and organizations are hoping that they can start to use drones as delivery vehicles
	   in the near future; Amazon Prime Air is a prime example. Drones are quickly gaining more and more functionality. DJI's Phantom X, which is still in the concept phase, promises
		features like tossing the vehicle into the air to activate it and
		smart sensors that will cause the drone to follow its operator around 
		(and even avoid obstacles in the process). The <span id = "italic">Guardian</span> writes that Imperial College and Southampton University are
		working on technology that will help drone's wings better mimic those of flying animals such as birds and bats. This will
		make the drones more aerodynamic, so they can fly greater distances at more economical costs. As time goes on, drone
		developers are trying to make their drones smarter, faster, cheaper, and in general, more efficient.
