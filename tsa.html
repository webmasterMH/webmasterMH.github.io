			<br />
			TSA, or Technology Student Association, is a nationwide competition
			for students spanning a broad range of
			interests and passions through a diversity of events. It fosters a love of STEM among students, and 
			provides an environment where they can incorporate their individual skills into a modern context.

			<span id = "em">Motto: </span>Learning To Live In A Technical World <br />
			<span id = "em">Creed: </span>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. 
			I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. 
			Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state,
			and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. 
			I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. 
			I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. 
			I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. 
			Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. 
			I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.

	    <h1>Our TSA Chapter</h1>
	    <p>
	    	The TSA chapter at Morris Hills High School prides itself on being
	    	a chapter that is almost entirely student-driven. As we are a 
	    	relatively new chapter, we have won few
	    	awards. Students meet on their
	    	own time, and are basically responsible for themselves. <br />
	    	Because our chapter encourages students to do all the work, it is 
	    	a team that fosters communication, self-motivation, and management,
	    	among other skills. <br />
	    	We are a rather small chapter, consisting of just 17 students, but
	    	our members have the work ethic to get things done.
