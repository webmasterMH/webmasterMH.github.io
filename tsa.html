	   <h1>What is TSA?</h1>

			interests and passions through a diversity of events.

	    <h1>Our TSA Chapter</h1>
	    <p>
	    	The TSA chapter at Morris Hills High School prides itself on being
	    	a chapter that is almost entirely student-driven. As we are a 
	    	relatively new chapter, we have won few
	    	awards. Students meet on their
	    	own time, and are basically responsible for themselves. <br />
	    	Because our chapter encourages students to do all the work, it is 
	    	a team that fosters communication, self-motivation, and management,
	    	among other skills. <br />
	    	We are a rather small chapter, consisting of just 17 students, but
	    	our members have the work ethic to get things done.
